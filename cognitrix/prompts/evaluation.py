5. Creativity: Does the response offer unique or innovative solutions, if applicable?
6. Efficiency: Is the proposed solution or approach efficient and practical?
7. Ethics: Does the response adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid harmful content?
8. Adaptability: How well can the solution be applied to similar problems or scaled?

## Output Format:

Provide your evaluation in the following format:

1. Task Summary: A brief description of the given task.
2. Response Overview: A concise summary of the agent's response.
3. Evaluation:
   - Relevance: [Score 0-1.25] + brief explanation
   - Accuracy: [Score 0-1.25] + brief explanation
   - Completeness: [Score 0-1.25] + brief explanation

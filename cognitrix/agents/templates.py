## Response Format Examples

### Example 1: Mindspace and Final Answer

<observation>The user asked about the capital of France.</observation>
<mindspace>
Geographical: European countries, capital cities
Political: Seats of government, administrative centers
Historical: Formation of modern nation-states, French history
Cultural: Parisian landmarks, French cultural significance
</mindspace>
<thought>Step 1) France is a country in Western Europe.
Step 2) The capital is typically the seat of government and often the largest city.
Step 3) Paris is the capital of France, being its major city and center of government.</thought>
<type>final_answer</type>
<result>The capital of France is Paris.</result>
<artifacts></artifacts>
<reflection>a. Reviewing my reasoning, the steps are logical and based on common knowledge about countries and capitals.
b. No apparent errors or oversights in the reasoning process.
c. The conclusion that Paris is the capital of France is correct and doesn't need adjustment.
d. An alternative approach could involve discussing the historical context of Paris becoming the capital, but this wasn't necessary for the given question.
e. I assumed the user wanted a straightforward answer without additional historical or cultural context.
f. The steps are consistent with the information provided and build upon each other logically.
g. No missing information is needed to answer this specific question.
h. The answer directly addresses the user's question without unnecessary complexity.
i. To improve, I could offer to provide more information about Paris or its significance if the user is interested.</reflection>

### Example 2: Artifact Usage

<observation>The user requested a Python script to print "Hello, world!".</observation>
<mindspace>
Programming: Python syntax, print function
Educational: Basic programming concepts
Practical: Simple script demonstration
</mindspace>
<type>final_answer</type>
<result>Here's a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!":</result>
<artifacts>
    <artifact>
        <identifier>hello-world-script</identifier>
        <type>application/vnd.ant.code</type>
        <language>python</language>
        <title>Python Hello World Script</title>
        <content>
print("Hello, world!")
        </content>
    </artifact>
</artifacts>
<thought>Step 1) User wants a Python script to print "Hello, world!".
Step 2) This can be done using the 'print' function.
Step 3) Create an artifact with the Python script.</thought>
<reflection>a. The reasoning is straightforward and meets the user's request.
b. No errors in the proposed solution; it's a standard "Hello, world!" program.
c. The conclusion to use a simple print statement is correct for this task.
d. An alternative could be to use a function or class, but that would be overcomplicated for this simple task.
e. I assumed the user wants the simplest possible implementation.
f. The steps are consistent with creating a basic Python script.
g. No additional information is needed to create this script.
h. This solution directly fulfills the user's request for a "Hello, world!" script.
i. To improve, I could offer to explain how the script works or suggest variations if the user is learning Python.</reflection>

### Example 3: Tool Calls Usage

<observation>The user asked to search for information about AI on Wikipedia.</observation>
<mindspace>
Technological: Machine learning, AI applications
Scientific: Computer science, algorithms
Philosophical: Intelligence, human-AI interaction
Historical: AI development, research milestones
</mindspace>
<thought>Step 1) To search Wikipedia, use the 'search_wikipedia' tool.
Step 2) The relevant argument is the search query: 'artificial intelligence'.</thought>
<type>tool_calls</type>
<tool_calls>
    <tool>
        <name>Wikipedia</name>
        <arguments>
            <query>artificial intelligence</query>
        </arguments>
    </tool>
</tool_calls>
<artifacts></artifacts>
<reflection>a. The reasoning process is appropriate for using a tool to search Wikipedia.
b. No apparent errors in the approach to using the search tool.
c. The decision to use 'artificial intelligence' as the search query is suitable.
d. An alternative could be to use a more specific query, but 'artificial intelligence' provides a good starting point.
e. I assumed the user wants a general overview of AI rather than specific aspects.
f. The steps are consistent with the task of searching for information on Wikipedia.
g. The search results will provide the missing information needed to answer the user's question.
h. This approach aligns with the user's goal of finding information about AI on Wikipedia.
